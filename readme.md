Overview
This project offers a collection of tools designed to automate common system maintenance tasks. The primary aim is to provide a calm, predictable workflow that reduces manual steps. The user interface leans toward clarity and simplicity. The software prioritizes safety, with built-in checks to minimize risk during cleanup and optimization. The repository hosts code that can be extended, tested, and audited by other developers and power users.

The core idea is to deliver dependable one-click actions. Users should expect consistent results across runs. The design favors fast execution, low resource usage during operation, and clear feedback about what was done and why it was done. This makes it suitable for tech-savvy individuals as well as system administrators who want a reproducible maintenance routine.

Features
- One-click maintenance routine: a streamlined sequence of cleanup, optimization, and housekeeping tasks.
- Deep clean: thorough removal of junk files, temp data, and traces that slow down the system.
- Performance monitoring: live insight into CPU, memory, disk, and network usage with clear visual cues.
- Safe operations: checks before each action, with the possibility to halt if a risk is detected.
- Modularity: extendable modules that can be added or swapped without breaking other parts.
- Lightweight footprint: designed to run quickly and minimize impact on active workloads.
- Cross-version compatibility: works with common Windows releases and configurations.
- Open collaboration: accessible to contributors who want to improve the tool or add features.

How it works
The project follows a simple, transparent pipeline:
1. Discover: detect installed components and current system state.
2. Plan: assemble a sequence of maintenance steps tailored to the current context.
3. Execute: run each step in a controlled environment with progress feedback.
4. Verify: check results, report outcomes, and roll back if needed.
5. Log: store a concise record of actions for auditing and troubleshooting.

The approach emphasizes clarity and safety over aggressive shortcuts. Each routine is designed to be idempotent where possible, so repeated runs do not cause unintended side effects. Logs provide a trail that helps diagnose issues and verify that maintenance was effective.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A Windows system with standard user privileges plus administrative rights for certain tasks. PowerShell is used for scripting tasks where applicable.
- What you get: a lightweight, modular set of scripts and binaries that can be run from a local folder or a packaged distribution.
- How to begin: download the latest release from the projectâ€™s Releases page, extract the package, and run the primary executable or script. The release package includes a ready-to-run launcher and a small set of helper utilities to perform maintenance tasks.

Installation and setup
- Download the latest release from the official page: https://github.com/andres070415/advanced-systemcare-tools/releases
- Extract the contents to a preferred location on your computer. The extraction creates a folder containing the launcher, modules, and auxiliary tools.
- Run the launcher with standard user privileges for initial assessment. Some actions require administrative rights; when prompted, grant the necessary elevation.
- Optional: configure a few core preferences, such as which cleanup tasks to enable by default, the frequency of automated checks, and the level of detail in logging.
- If you want to confirm integrity, verify the included checksums and compare them against the provided hashes in the release notes.

Usage: one-click maintenance
- Start the one-click maintenance flow. The tool presents a summary of planned actions and asks for confirmation before executing any step.
- Typical sequence:
  - Disk cleanup: remove temporary files, cached data, and shadow items that accumulate over time.
  - System optimization: adjust startup entries, service fine-tuning, and registry housekeeping where appropriate.
  - Privacy and traces: clear browser caches, application traces, and telemetry signals that are safe to remove.
  - System health checks: verify disk health status, ensure drivers are current, and test basic system responsiveness.
- After completion, you receive a concise report that highlights improvements and any items that require attention.
- Optional: export the report as a text or HTML file for sharing with support teams or for future reference.

Deep cleaning and optimization routines
- The deep clean module focuses on removing stubborn junk and residual data that standard cleanup misses.
- It targets:
  - System caches and old logs
  - Temp directories across user profiles
  - Redundant registry entries (with a cautionary flag to avoid risky changes)
  - Temporary app data and installation leftovers
- Optimization routines adjust parameters to improve reliability and responsiveness:
  - Startup optimization to reduce boot time
  - Service and process prioritization to balance performance
  - Disk traversal and fragmentation checks (where applicable)
  - Memory management tips to keep active workloads smooth
- The goal is to remove entropy without destabilizing the environment. The routines are conservative by design and use safe defaults.

Performance monitoring
- Real-time dashboards display CPU, RAM, disk I/O, network activity, and temperature indicators when available.
- Key metrics include:
  - CPU load distribution and per-core usage
  - Free memory and active page file usage
  - Disk throughput and queue depth
  - Network throughput and latency
- Visual cues help users spot anomalies quickly. Historical graphs show trends over time to help plan maintenance windows.

Safety and integrity
- Every action includes a pre-check. If a risk is detected, the operation pauses and prompts for confirmation or cancellation.
- The tool uses safe defaults for dangerous operations. It avoids irreversible changes unless explicitly approved.
- Rollback is supported for many cleanup steps when possible. If a cleanup leads to an unintended consequence, you can revert to the previous state.
- Integrity checks ensure that the launcher, modules, and scripts have not been tampered with between runs.

System requirements
- Windows 10 or later is recommended for broad compatibility.
- Sufficient disk space for temporary files and backup data during maintenance.
- Administrative rights needed for full effect; non-admin runs cover safe, non-destructive actions.
- Network access is optional but helpful for feature updates and telemetry when enabled by the user.

Architecture and modules
- Launcher: the entry point that coordinates all tasks, handles user input, displays progress, and writes logs.
- Core engine: orchestrates the execution order, applies safety checks, and handles error recovery.
- Cleanup module: implements file and registry cleanup routines with safeguards.
- Optimization module: tunes startup behavior, services, and scheduling for better performance.
- Privacy module: isolates and clears data that may reveal user activity.
- Monitoring module: collects metrics and presents them in a readable format.
- Extensions API: allows third-party modules to integrate with the tool and introduce new tasks.

Data formats and inputs
- The system reads state information from standard Windows APIs and system probes.
- Input data is stored in structured logs with timestamps, task IDs, and results.
- Output reports can be generated as plain text or HTML, suitable for sharing with support staff.
- The configuration file uses a simple, human-readable syntax for ease of modification.

Advanced usage
- Scripting and automation: you can trigger maintenance routines via a script or a scheduled task.
- Custom modules: developers can add modules that implement new tasks, provided they adhere to the module interface.
- Conditional routines: scripts can tailor the maintenance sequence based on detected conditions, such as low disk space or high CPU temperature.
- Logging and auditing: enable verbose logging to create a complete audit trail of actions and outcomes.

Automation and scripting
- Command-line interface:
  - --help: shows usage details
  - --run: executes the default maintenance sequence
  - --module [name]: runs a specific module
  - --config [path]: uses an external configuration file
  - --log [path]: writes logs to the given file
- Scheduled automation:
  - Create a Windows Task Scheduler entry to run maintenance at a chosen interval.
  - Use a separate configuration to customize frequency and scope for automated runs.
- Scripting patterns:
  - Use short, deterministic task names for reliability.
  - Capture return codes for integration with other automation pipelines.
  - Prefer non-interactive modes for unattended runs.

Testing and quality
- Unit tests verify individual functions in isolation, focusing on correctness and edge cases.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows across modules.
- Manual testing guided by test plans ensures the UI and CLI behave as expected.
- Quality gates include static analysis and dependency checks to catch common issues early.

Localization and accessibility
